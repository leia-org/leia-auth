# Regression and integration tests

Implements [development #114](https://github.com/leia-org/development/issues/114).

```sh
npm ci
npm run test:regression
```

`npm test` runs the same finite suite; `npm run test:watch` is available for development. CI runs the regression command on Node 22 and 24 for pull requests and pushes to `main`/`develop`, without service credentials.

HTTP API key permissions with signed JWTs, expired/invalid/session tokens, internal Runner credential resolution and provider isolation. Existing auth, default-key, encryption, validation and session-cookie tests also run.

External side effects are replaced at the database, HTTP adapter/fetch, Redis or model-provider boundary. No MongoDB, Redis server or paid model API is needed. These tests complement browser and deployed-stack end-to-end tests.

## Integration tests

```sh
npm run test:integration
```

Real login/password hashing, session-cookie refresh/logout and the create/list/default-switch/delete API key lifecycle use MongoDB and production encryption. Runner revocations use a local HTTP peer.

CI runs integration separately on Node 24. No production service/repository method is mocked; local HTTP peers supply deterministic contracts for external dependencies. These suites do not assert real LLM answer quality or live audio.

Set `TEST_MONGO_URI` to a dedicated MongoDB 8 instance, e.g. `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017`. A new UUID-named database is created and dropped per run. A missing URL fails the suite explicitly.
